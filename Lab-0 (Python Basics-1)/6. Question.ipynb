    "## Problem Statement: Student Course Management System\n",
    "Create a simple Student Course Management System using Python lists. The system should allow for the following functionalities:\n",
    "- Add a new student to the system.\n",
    "- Enroll a student in a course.\n",
    "- Drop a course for a student.\n",
    "- List all students enrolled in a specific course.\n",
    "- List all courses a student is enrolled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Each student is identified by a unique student ID (an integer).\n",
    "- Each course is identified by a unique course ID (a string).\n",
    "- Use Python lists to manage students and their course enrollments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functionalities Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Add a New Student\n",
    "- Function: add_student(student_id)\n",
    "- Description: Adds a new student with the given student_id to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Enroll a Student in a Course\n",
    "- Function: enroll_student_in_course(student_id, course_id)\n",
    "- Description: Enrolls the student with student_id in the specified course_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Drop a Course for a Student\n",
    "- Function: drop_student_from_course(student_id, course_id)\n",
    "- Description: Drops the specified course_id for the student with student_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) List All Students Enrolled in a Specific Course\n",
    "- Function: list_students_in_course(course_id)\n",
    "- Description: Lists all students enrolled in the specified course_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) List All Courses a Student is Enrolled In\n",
    "- Function: list_courses_for_student(student_id)\n",
    "- Description: Lists all courses that the student with student_id is enrolled in."
